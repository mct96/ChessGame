<h1>â™• Chess â™›</h1>
</center>

A small project of a chess game.

## The highlights are:

- âŽŒ Support history of moves, so there is the possibility to redo/undo moves.
- ðŸ“– Support to read from a pgn file.
- ðŸ”§ No third part code, so there no external dependencies.
- ðŸ¤– It's possible to list all possibles moves for a given piece in the game.
- ðŸš€ Efficient (run time) was keep in mind when developing, so the performance should be great.


## TODOs

- In fact, I don't have time to write the GUI. I'm not a fan of heavy IDEs like Qt and the process of writing from scratch is very time expensive for me.
